[Albert Cairo's](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/) "The Truthful Art:  data, charts, and maps for communication" is referenced in Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund's "R for Data Science" as a book worth reading.  Even though I try to be as deliberate, careful, and creative as possible when generating graphics I figured if this book was getting a shout out from a legend like Hadley Wickham then I should give it a go.  

The text is chock-full of well-designed, informative, insightful graphics so leafing through the book is worthwhile.  The main points -- at least those I highlighted or summarized in the margins -- are the following:

1.  An informative, accurate, and persuasive graphic has certain qualities (p.45):
    i)  It is truthful:  it is based on thorough and honest research.  
    ii)  It is functional:  it is an accurate depiction of the data.
    iii)  It is beautiful:  attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience.
    iv)  It is insightful:  reveals evidence that would be hard to see otherwise.
    v)  It is enlightening:  if the evidence it depicts is understood and accepted it will change our minds for the better.  

2.  Simplicity:  data visualization is **not** the same as data decoration.
