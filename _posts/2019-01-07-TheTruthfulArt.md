[Albert Cairo's](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/) "The Truthful Art:  data, charts, and maps for communication" is referenced in Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund's "R for Data Science" as a book worth reading.  Even though I try to be as deliberate, careful, and creative as possible when generating graphics I figured if this book was getting a shout out from a legend like Hadley Wickham then I should give it a go.  

The text is chock-full of well-designed, informative, insightful graphics so leafing through the book is worthwhile.  The main points -- at least those I highlighted or summarized in the margins -- are the following:

1.  An informative, accurate, and persuasive graphic has certain qualities (p.45):
        i)  It is truthful:  it is based on thorough and honest research.
        ii)  It is functional:  it is an accurate depiction of the data.
        iii)  It is beautiful:  attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience.
        iv)  It is insightful:  reveals evidence that would be hard to see otherwise.
        v)  It is enlightening:  if the evidence it depicts is understood and accepted it will change our minds for the better.  

2.  Simplicity:  data visualization is **not** the same as data decoration (p.56).  

3.  "When doing a visualization, or the analysis that precedes it, always ask yourself:  compared to what, to whom, to when, to where...?" (p.90).

4.  On simplicity:  "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful" (p. 97; quote reproduced from *The Laws of Simplicity* by John Maeda).  Cairo's follow-up:  "Simplicity isn't just about *reduction*.  It can (and should) also be about *augmentation*.  It consists of removing what isn't relevant from our models but also of bringing in those elements that are essential to making those models truer."
