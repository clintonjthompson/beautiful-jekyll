[Albert Cairo's](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/) "The Truthful Art:  data, charts, and maps for communication" is referenced in Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund's "R for Data Science" as a book worth reading.  Even though I try to be as deliberate, careful, and creative as possible when generating graphics I figured if this book was getting a shout out from a legend like Hadley Wickham then I should give it a go.  

The text is chock-full of well-designed, informative, insightful graphics so leafing through the book is worthwhile.  The main points -- at least those I highlighted or summarized in the margins -- are the following:

1.  An informative, accurate, and persuasive graphic has certain qualities (p.45):
        
       i)  It is truthful:  it is based on thorough and honest research.
       ii)  It is functional:  it is an accurate depiction of the data.
       iii)  It is beautiful:  attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience.
       iv)  It is insightful:  reveals evidence that would be hard to see otherwise.
       v)  It is enlightening:  if the evidence it depicts is understood and accepted it will change our minds for the better.  

2.  Simplicity:  data visualization is **not** the same as data decoration (p.56).  

3.  "When doing a visualization, or the analysis that precedes it, always ask yourself:  compared to what, to whom, to when, to where...?" (p.90).

4.  On simplicity:  "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful" (p. 97; quote reproduced from *The Laws of Simplicity* by John Maeda).  
        Cairo's follow-up:  "Simplicity isn't just about *reduction*.  It can (and should) also be about *augmentation*.  It consists of removing what isn't relevant from our models but also of bringing in those elements that are essential to making those models truer."  

5.  The skills of an educated person (p.97), as suggested by cartographer Mark Monmonier in his book *Mapping It Out*:

       i)  Literacy, or fluency in written expression and understanding of texts.
       ii)  Articulacy, or fluency in oral communication.
       iii)  Numeracy, or fluency in analyzing, summarizing, and presenting data.
       iv)  Graphicacy, or fluency in interpreting and using visuals.  
 
The remainder of the book covers some basic statistical concepts, e.g. variable types, standardization, hypothesis testing, etc., in the context of creating meaningful graphics.  

This book isn't a recipe-book, that is, it doesn't feature code on **how** to create many of the graphics featured inside --- you will need to consult a book about R's *ggplot2*, for instance, but it does reinforce this quote from John W. Tukey (p.151):  
> The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.
