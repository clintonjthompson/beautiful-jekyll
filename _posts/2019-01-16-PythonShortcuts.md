Learning any new programming language is easier if a handful of keyboard shortcuts are memorized.  Using Spyder, here is my working list:    

* `Ctrl + Enter` = Run selected line(s) in Python editor 
* `Ctrl + Shift + E` = Tab to Python editor
* `Ctrl + Shift + I` = Tab to Python Console
* `%pwd` = Print Working Directory
* `%run` = Run Python program from IPython session.  Note the name of the program follows `%run`.  
* `Ctrl + L`, `%clear` = Clear screen
* `dir()` = Lists defined objects (names in current scope)
