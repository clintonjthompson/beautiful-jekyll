This website (blog?) is really just a way for me to easily log -- and remember -- the code and concepts I'm learning and using in R, Python, and Linux.  

### What else?  

I have used R off and on for a few years, although I now use it daily.  Aiming to become more of a power user and to supplement my work with Python.  I also just started using Linux and whatever tips and tricks I learn along the way using Linux, I'll document here, too.
